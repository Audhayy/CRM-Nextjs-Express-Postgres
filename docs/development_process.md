## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- **Approach**: Normalized schema with proper relationships
- **Models**: 
  - Users (authentication and roles)
  - Customers (core entity with tags and notes)
  - Leads (sales pipeline with stages)
  - Tasks (follow-ups and reminders)
  - Interactions (contact history)
- **Relationships**: Foreign keys with cascade options
- **Indexing**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields

### API Architecture
- **Pattern**: REST-based with modular structure
- **Layers**:
  - Routes (endpoint definitions)
  - Controllers (business logic)
  - Services (data operations)
  - Models (database schema)
- **Validation**: Joi schemas for request validation
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based middleware

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **State Management**: Context API for global state
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom components
- **Routing**: File-based routing with dynamic routes
- **API Integration**: Axios with interceptors
- **Error Handling**: React Error Boundaries

### Security Implementation
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation with sanitization
- **CORS**: Configured for production domains
- **Rate Limiting**: Express-rate-limit middleware
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js implementation
